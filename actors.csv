Kangana Ranaut,"I schooled in Himachal Pradesh. I had taken up science and, initially, wanted to become a doctor. There are few career options for students of science though, so I shifted to Delhi and decided to try theater instead. I joined a group called Ashmita, and did two plays there -- Madhavi and Rakht Kalyan. As I was still unsure of what I wanted to do, I began sending photographs of myself to advertising agencies. I even took up classes in French because I thought of shifting to Paris, where models have always had a chance."

They would always discuss my career whenever I'd visit them, but they are now very happy as Gangster is doing well. In fact, Himachal Pradesh is proud of me! I keep getting calls from there. I'm very happy now, but I'm sure that when I'm older, I will miss being a student and not going to college. I should be writing love letters at this age. Instead, I'm working day and night. Then again, you can't get everything in life." (5-4-2006),My biggest asset is that I know how to learn and that, I believe will help me in the long run.

Vijayakanth,,,Vijayakanth, who's affectionately called 'Puratchi Kalaignar' and 'Captain' by his fans and well-wishers, had to face so many challenges and unfriendly situations before he could achieve the fame and popularity he's enjoying to-day in Tamil filmfield. He, whose original name was Vijayaraj, was born on 25th August, at Madurai, Tamilnadu, his parents being Azhagarsamy-Andal. When he was one year old his mother Andal passed away. His parents had three more children. To bring up the one year old baby Vijayakanth and because of the pressure exerted upon Vijayakanth's father by all the family members, the latter (Father of Vijayakanth) married one Rukmani as his second wife. This couple gave birth to 7 children. All these members now live together happily in a joint family. From 1st std. to 5th std. Vijayakanth studied at a particular school. He finished his 6th std. at M.C.High School. He pursued his 7th and 8th std. at Devakottai school. He did his 9th std. at a different school. 10th and 11th std. were studied by him at St. Mary's school. During that period, Vijayakanth was looking after his father's rice-mill business. So he couldn't pursue his studies beyond 11th std. Vijayakanth had some close friends then. One notable friend among them was A.Se. Ibrahim Rawther (who's even now with Vijayakanth as if his own-brother and has also earned the distinction of being one of the leading film producers in cinefield). All these friends in those days used to gather together near Sena's Films, a films distribution company, at Madurai. Marsook, the proprietor-distributor of Sena's Films, used to keenly observe the activities of Vijayakanth. One day he asked Vijayakanth whether the latter was interested in acting in films. Out of pressure from his friends, Vijayakanth agreed to act in films. Subsequently he (Vijayakanth) was booked for acting in the film "Yen Kelvikku Yenna Pathil?". Yet, after some time, he was dropped from the project on the ground that he was not good at Tamil dialogue delivery. This elicited a great passion within his heart that he took a vow to get into cine acting with renewed efforts and to make his career a rewarding success! With this one objective in mind, he knocked at the doors of each and every film company asking for acting chance. But there was not any positive response. Marsook had then distributed so many films directed by M.A.Kaja! Vijayakanth was introduced to Kaja by Marsook. As a result Vijayakanth was booked in "Inikkum Ilamai". This was the first film acted by Vijayakanth. After this, he acted in "Thooraththu Idi Muzhakkam", "Neerottam" and "Agal Vilakku". These films didn't bring great success. Yet Vijayakanth too didn't lose heart. He waited for good opportunity. 'Vadaloor Combines' proprietor Chidambaram saw "Neerottam" at Krishnaveni theatre, T.Nagar, Chennai. Seeing Vijayakanth in action, he started developing some interest in him as he identified some hopeful, positive traits in his (Viyayakanth's) style of acting and personality. He wanted to produce a film by booking Vijayakanth. His wish got materialized through "Sattam Oru Iruttarai". In this project too there arose stiff opposition from some quarters protesting against giving the hero chance to Vijayakanth in the film! Yet, overlooking all these objections, the producer stood firm in his decision and made Vijayakanth the hero! S.A.Chandrasekaran directed this film. When, finally, the film got released, it proved to be a grand success! Subsequently Vijayakanth was booked in 18 new films. While he was doing these films, at a specific period, his cinema market started becoming dull again! At this juncture, the film "Saatchi" was released. Vijayakanth had done the lead role in it. S.A.Chandrasekaran had directed it. P.S.Veerappa had produced it. This film, in it's turn, created a new success record. The following is a popular dialogue written by Kalaignar Karunanidhi: "Veezhvathu Naamaaga Irunthaalum Vazhvathu Thamizhaaga Irukkattum".Vijayakanth picked up these words as his heart-loving golden rule. Whenever he addresses any function or releases some press statement or birth day message, he uses to add the words 'Tamil', 'Tamil', 'Tamil' as one of his most ideal slogans. The recent release "Ulavuththurai" is his 125th film. Upto this film he hasn't so far acted even in a single, other language film. He's the only Tamil actor who has achieved this distinction! Though actor Sarathkumar had already acted in films before, his role in "Pulan Visaranai" in which he teamed with Vijayakanth proved to be one of the great limelights in his acting career. Vijayakanth introduced Mansoor Alikhan to filmfield through his "Captain Prabaharan". He (Vijayakanth) has introduced through his different films, film institute students like R.K.Selvamani, R.Aravintharaj, Ilavarasan and a few others as newface film directors. Many different newface heroines also have got introduced through his films. Though Vijayakanth hasn't acted in other language films, each and every film of him has been dubbed into Telugu language and thus has led to huge revenue collection too!

He earned his image as an actor with the film, 'Nooraavathu Naal', and gradually weaned his way in a successful manner as villains opposite protagonists in movies. He made his debut as the hero in the movie, 'Saavi', and from 'Iravu Pookkal' onwards, he was a regular protagonist in motion pictures.
